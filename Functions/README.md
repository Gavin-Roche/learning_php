# PHP Functions Demo
This script contains six simple PHP functions demonstrating:
- Checking if a number is even or odd.
- Comparing two variables for identical or equal values.
- Getting the first and last characters of a string.
- Printing an associative arrayâ€™s key-value pairs.
- Concatenating array values into a single string.

Each function is tested with example inputs, and the results are displayed on the webpage.
